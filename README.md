Ninja-Game
==========

  This game centers around a ninja who fights his way through the world. He can fight his enemies with his sword in addition to using special abilities such as poison or invisibility. He will gradually work his way through the levels, climbing atop trees and buildings and vanquishing his foes.

  I've been working on this game for around two years. Development is currently on hold, but I might continue working on it after I finish some of my other projects. I used the Cocos2D framework as my game engine and created my images and animations with GIMP and Flash.
